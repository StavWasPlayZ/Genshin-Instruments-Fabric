## Reporting Bugs
It's very common I do an oopsie while I code.  
For most developers too.  
If you observe a wrong behavior and believe I am at fault, feel free to compose a bug report!

I would appreciate reports that state more than _"My game crashed!"_, but rather, what you *did* to achieve such a state.

**MAKE SURE TO ATTACH YOUR FULL `debug.log`/`latest.log`, REGARDLESS OF THE BUG TYPE!**  
Online tutorials for how to retrieve one are present online.

## Why won't he respond to my query??
GitHub has 1 dire issue: that I for some reason, sometimes, don't get notified one new
issues/PRs being made.  
If you notice a lack of response, please DM me in CurseForge and I'll be sure to be present!
